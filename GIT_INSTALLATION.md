2. Click "Next" through the installation wizard, accepting the default options
3. On the "Adjusting your PATH environment" screen, select "Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software"
4. Continue clicking "Next" with default options until installation completes
5. Click "Finish"

## Step 3: Verify Installation
1. Close any open Command Prompt windows
